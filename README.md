# SLACE: A Monotone and Balance-Sensitive Loss Function for Ordinal Regression

## Introduction
Ordinal text classification is a special case oftext classification, in which there is an ordinal relationship among classes.
We suggest a novel loss function, WOCEL (weighted ordinal cross entropy loss), making use of information theory considerations and class ordinality.
